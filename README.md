## What is this?

It's a Tumblr theme for the Skokie Public Library.

## Is it any good?

It's not too bad. It's clean and simple.

## Can I use it?

Yep, it's MIT licensed.

## How do I use it?

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)

Install gulp

`npm install --global gulp`

Clone this repository

`git clone git@github.com:skokielibrary/tumblr.git`

Install gulp modules

`npm install`

From the project's root directory run:

`gulp build`

This rebuilds the `dist/tumblr.html` file, which is the template you need for Tumblr.

## How do I use this on Tumblr?

Run `gulp build` from the project root to make sure your files are all up to date. Copy the contents of `dist/tumblr.html` and paste it in to the theme editor on Tumblr.

Yeah, it's a whole lotta copying and pasting.

## How do I make changes to this?

Start with Tumblr's [theme development documentation](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes) and let your imagination go crazy.

## Anything else?

The theme is based on/inspired by the Tumblr Boilerplate. [https://github.com/davesantos/tumblr-boilerplate](https://github.com/davesantos/tumblr-boilerplate)
